first time you run it,
    * if it finds a config file, it uses it as below
    * if it does not find a config file, it
        generates a config file with template instructions
        notifies user that it has done this and what the file is called
    * exits

if it finds a config file, it
    * uses this config file to determine where to look etc
    * outputs results to a file
    * exits

if it finds a results file, it
    * asks the user to confirm purge or redo the search
        * if user redoes the search, it
            * uses the config file to do the search as above
            * overwrites the previous results file
            * exits
        * if user chooses to purge, it
            * uses the results file to purge the matching tokens from all the locale files
